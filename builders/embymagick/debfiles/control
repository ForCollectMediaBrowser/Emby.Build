Description: low-level image manipulation library -- quantum depth Q8
 The MagickCore API is a low-level interface between the C programming language
 and the ImageMagick image processing libraries and is recommended for
 wizard-level programmers only. Unlike the MagickWand C API which uses only a
 few opaque types and accessors, with MagickCore you almost exclusively access
 the structure members directly.
 .
 This package contains the C libraries needed to run executables that make
 use of MagickCore.
 .
 This version of libmagickcore is compiled for quantum depth of 8 bits
 and specifically for the emby project.

Description: image manipulation library
 The MagickWand API is the recommended interface between the C programming
 language and the ImageMagick image processing libraries. Unlike the
 MagickCore C API, MagickWand uses only a few opaque types. Accessors are
 available to set or get important wand properties.

 This package contains the C libraries needed to run executables that make
 use of MagickWand.

 This version of libmagickwand is compiled for quantum depth of 8 bits
 and specifically for the emby project.
